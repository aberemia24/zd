## 🧗 CHALLENGES & OBSTACLES

### 🔴 Major Challenges Overcome:

1. **Complex Dependency Web**
   - **Challenge**: Multiple packages pulling different React type versions
   - **Root Cause**: @testing-library/react, zustand, @types/react-router-dom conflicts
   - **Solution**: Granular overrides targeting each problematic dependency
   - **Lesson**: Dependency resolution requires package-specific targeting

2. **Runtime vs Compile-time Issues**
   - **Challenge**: Application ran but couldn't compile for production
   - **Root Cause**: Mixed React 18 runtime with React 19 types
   - **Solution**: Forced consistency through comprehensive overrides
   - **Lesson**: Runtime compatibility ≠ build compatibility

3. **Architecture Misunderstanding**
   - **Challenge**: Initially assumed NestJS backend was functional
   - **Root Cause**: Misinterpreted monorepo structure
   - **Solution**: Clarified frontend-only + Supabase architecture
   - **Lesson**: Architecture validation is critical before debugging

4. **React Hooks Rules Violations**
   - **Challenge**: TransactionForm had conditional hook calls
   - **Root Cause**: Early returns before all hooks were called
   - **Solution**: Moved all hooks to component beginning with safe fallbacks
   - **Lesson**: Hook order consistency is non-negotiable

### ⚠️ Technical Debt Identified:
- ESLint warnings remain (acceptable for development)
- Some unused imports in generated types
- ComponentMap could benefit from more granular error handling

## 🎓 LESSONS LEARNED

### 🔍 Technical Insights:

1. **Dependency Management Strategy**
   - **Learning**: Overrides are more powerful than resolutions for React ecosystems
   - **Application**: Use granular overrides targeting specific problematic packages
   - **Future Impact**: Template for handling complex dependency conflicts

2. **TypeScript Version Compatibility**
   - **Learning**: TypeScript versions must align with build tool requirements
   - **Application**: Always verify TypeScript version against react-scripts constraints
   - **Future Impact**: Version validation before major updates

3. **React Types Ecosystem**
   - **Learning**: React 19 types are incompatible with React 18 runtime
   - **Application**: Force consistent type versions across entire dependency tree
   - **Future Impact**: Automated version checking in CI/CD

4. **Schema Evolution Strategy**
   - **Learning**: Adding columns during active development requires careful coordination
   - **Application**: Frontend types must match backend schema exactly
   - **Future Impact**: Schema-first development approach
