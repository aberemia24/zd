# Hybrid Excel + Hover Actions Pattern

**Date**: 07 Iunie 2025  
**Task**: LunarGrid Simplification V3 - Design Decision Documentation  
**Status**: ✅ **APPROVED FOR IMPLEMENTATION**  

## Decision: IMPLEMENT HYBRID PATTERN

### Rationale

1. **Familiar Excel-like double-click editing**
   - Users expect double-click to edit in spreadsheet-like interfaces
   - Maintains muscle memory from Excel/Google Sheets
   - Zero learning curve for editing workflow

2. **Progressive disclosure with hover actions**
   - Hover reveals available actions without overwhelming the interface
   - Discoverability: Users can see what actions are possible
   - Clean UI by default, actionable UI on demand

3. **Better discoverability for advanced features**
   - Current problem: Users don't know single-click opens modal
   - Solution: Hover shows [✏️ edit] [⋯ more] buttons clearly
   - Reduces cognitive load and user confusion

4. **Mobile-friendly (long press = hover)**
   - Touch devices: 500ms long-press shows hover actions
   - Unified interaction model across devices
   - No separate mobile interaction patterns needed

## Pattern Specification

### Desktop Interactions
```
Normal State:     [  €123.45  ]                    (clean, minimal)
Selected State:   [  €123.45  ] ← border highlight (shows it's selected)
Hover on Selected:[  €123.45  ✏️ ⋯]               (progressive disclosure)
Editing State:    [€[123.45__]]                    (inline input mode)
```

### Interaction Mapping
| **User Action** | **Result** | **Purpose** |
|---|---|---|
| **Single click** | Select cell (show border highlight) | Indicates selection, prepares for hover actions |
| **Hover on selected** | Show [✏️ edit] [⋯ more] buttons | Progressive disclosure of available actions |
| **Double click** | Enter inline edit mode directly | Excel-like editing shortcut, power user friendly |
| **F2 key** | Enter inline edit mode | Standard spreadsheet keyboard shortcut |
| **Enter** (when editing) | Save and move down | Excel-like behavior |
| **Enter** (when selected) | Enter inline edit mode | Alternative to F2 |
| **Escape** (when editing) | Cancel edit | Standard cancel behavior |
| **Escape** (when selected) | Deselect cell | Clear selection |

### Mobile Interactions
```
Touch & Hold (500ms): Shows hover actions [✏️ edit] [⋯ more]
Quick Tap: Select cell
Double Tap: Enter inline edit mode
```

### Hover Actions Specification
```typescript
// When cell is selected AND hovered:
<div className="absolute right-1 top-1 flex gap-1 opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100">
  <button onClick={startEdit} title="Edit inline (F2)">
    <Edit2 size={14} />  // Lucide icon
  </button>
  <button onClick={openModal} title="Mai multe opțiuni">
    <MoreHorizontal size={14} />  // Lucide icon
  </button>
</div>
```

## Implementation Plan: Two-Phase Approach

### Phase 2.2-2.3: Simplify EditableCell (Tasks 4-5)
1. **Remove over-engineering** (957 → 400 lines)
   - Delete: Enhanced ARIA, Performance monitoring, Focus trap logic
   - Delete: Triple event handlers, Excessive memoization
   - Keep: Core editing functionality, basic validation

2. **Add Hybrid Pattern** 
   - State: `showHoverActions`, `longPressTimer`
   - Single click → select only (remove direct modal opening)
   - Hover actions → Edit button + More button
   - Mobile long-press → show hover actions

### Phase 2.4-2.6: Polish & Test (Tasks 6-7)
3. **Keyboard navigation integration**
   - F2/Enter/Escape work with new hover system
   - Accessibility: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation for hover buttons
   
4. **Testing & Documentation**
   - E2E Playwright tests for all interaction patterns
   - Comprehensive documentation of new behavior

## Success Criteria

### ✅ **Functional Requirements**
- [ ] All existing EditableCell functionality preserved
- [ ] Single click selects cell (no direct modal)
- [ ] Hover on selected shows [✏️] [⋯] buttons
- [ ] Double click enters edit mode immediately
- [ ] F2/Enter keyboard shortcuts work
- [ ] Mobile long-press (500ms) shows hover actions

### ✅ **UX Requirements**  
- [ ] Progressive disclosure: clean by default, actionable on hover
- [ ] Excel-like familiarity for editing workflows
- [ ] Better discoverability of modal functionality
- [ ] Consistent behavior across desktop and mobile

### ✅ **Technical Requirements**
- [ ] Component reduced from 957 to ~300 lines
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing props interface
- [ ] Accessibility compliance maintained
- [ ] Performance improvement from reduced complexity

### ✅ **Testing Requirements**
- [ ] Playwright E2E tests cover all interaction patterns
- [ ] Manual testing on desktop (hover) and mobile (long-press)
- [ ] Keyboard navigation testing (F2, Enter, Escape)
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility verification

## Rollback Plan

**If implementation fails or causes issues:**

1. **Quick Rollback**: Git revert to backup commit
   - `EditableCell.backup.tsx` serves as immediate fallback
   - All dependencies documented in `EditableCell.dependencies.md`

2. **Partial Rollback**: Keep simplification, remove hover pattern
   - Simplification (957→400 lines) is valuable on its own
   - Hover actions can be removed while keeping cleaner code

3. **Feature Flag**: Toggle hover actions via prop
   - `showHoverActions={false}` returns to original behavior
   - Gradual rollout possible

## Why This Approach?

### ✅ **Better than Status Quo**
- Current: Single click → modal (unexpected, poor discoverability)
- New: Single click → select, hover → actions (predictable, discoverable)

### ✅ **Better than Complex Alternatives**
- **Alternative**: Context menus, complex UI chrome
- **Our choice**: Simple hover pattern, minimal UI impact

### ✅ **Better than Academic Solutions**
- **Alternative**: Enterprise-grade interaction frameworks
- **Our choice**: Pragmatic Excel-inspired pattern
